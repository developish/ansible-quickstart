# Getting Started with Ansible

Requires:

* Vagrant

To get started:

    $ vagrant up

This will download the box, update it and install ansible.

From there, modify ansible/main.yml to taste and run:

    $ vagrant provision --provision-with ansible

See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html for the docs.
